# QQ_1D_Navier_Stokes_Conjecture_Simulator

CRITICAL NOTE FOR RESEARCHERS: This tool simulates a 1D Reaction-Diffusion Partial Differential Equation (PDE). While it demonstrates phenomena analogous to those in fluid dynamics, such as; diffusion (viscosity-like effects) and non-linear interactions, and is fundamentally not a model of the 3D Navier-Stokes equations.

The results from this simulator cannot be used to draw direct conclusions about 3D fluid flow or address the Navier-Stokes existence and smoothness conjecture. Its purpose is for the conceptual exploration of 1D pattern formation, wave propagation, and the interplay between diffusion and reaction terms.

BETA SOFTWARE NOTICE: This application is under active development. While we strive for numerical accuracy for the implemented PDE, bugs or unexpected behaviors may be present. Your use of this tool acknowledges its experimental status.
