# QQ_1D_Navier_Stokes_Conjecture_Simulator
ABOUT:
This simulator models a **1D Reaction-Diffusion PDE** as an *analogue*, and is still in development. It is **NOT** a direct simulation of the 3D Navier-Stokes equations and cannot be used to prove or disprove the Navier-Stokes existence and smoothness conjecture.
Its purpose is for conceptual understanding of related PDE phenomena.
